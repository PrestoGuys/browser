    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Made By PrestoGuys in 2024</p>
    <p>
        PG Magician is a iFrame browser aimed for school, not for learing of course! 
        You can use PG Magician to play games and browse some of the internet. 
        But sadly a lot of website block iFrames, so, you may not beable to look at a website. 
        I am am trying to think of a way to work around it. 
        If you have any sugesions on how to work around it, please tell me!
